Hello and welcome to our Project 1 Repository. There were three main questions we attempted to answer in this project about Formula 1 Racing. Those questions are as follows:
How much does the average pit stop time of a driver
 per race affect their finishing position?
How much does the starting grid position of a driver
 affect their finishing position?
How much does weather affect the average pit stop
 time and average driver finishing position?
Included in this repository is the Kaggle document we utilized to guide us along our data analysis. The CSVâ€™s we pulled data from are located in the Formula_1_csv folder, the code we created to make our figures, the final analysis PowerPoint, and the written analysis for the entire project
